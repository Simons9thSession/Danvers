    <td><p>Hey I just found out about this place called Kings Park Psyche Center on Long Island, and I paid a visit to its many buildings. Here is one of the first of many buildings that are on the massive campus:</p> <center> <img src="https://simons9thsession.github.io/Danvers/assets/images/Building 22.jpg"> 
<small><i>"Pictured above is Building 22 and out of frame to its left is Building 21."</small></i></p></center>
<p>This building has been standing there in place since it had been constructed in 1955, towards the end of the institutions life most patients from the other many residences on campus were brought here. Post closure the state commissioned a report in an effort to determine if anything was worth preserving. Unfortunately this building did not make the cut due to the fact that it does "<i>not contribute, historically, or aesthetically to the campus</i>". Luckily due to the cluttered nature of bureaucracy, these buildings will most likely outlive us. </p> <center><img src="https://simons9thsession.github.io/Danvers/assets/images/VintageBuilding22.JPG" loading="lazy"> <small><i>"A picture of Building 22 sometime in the early to late '90s."</small></i></p></center>
<p>The building was a cool explore during the <b>SEVEN</b> whole hours I spent there, and I don't think I saw everything that there is to see. I'll post more photos later tonight. </p>

    <td><p>These buildings look like they have asbestos or other hazards in them, is bringing a gas mask such as the M50 a good idea? Also great post looking forward for more pictures! <img src="https://www.uer.ca/emote/7.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></p></td>

<p>The buildings actually do <b>HAVE</b> asbestos in them but it is not that significant unless you are living in the buildings like some sorta creep yk.</p>
<p>Anyway I have returned to dump the rest of my pictures! It seems most people tend to forget that all the doctors and other medical staff lived on the very same campus as the patients. So weird to see these houses eaten away by vegation and natural decay, considering that some time ago they were filled with life. </p>
